recap


science?
set of rules (knowlegde)

engingeering?
designing(not coding) a solution for a new problem (using the knowldge of science or your common sense or out of box thinking)

keep it simple


technology?
the tool (or solution) engineered for solving a problem is called technology. 

craft?
conventional skills that are passed from generation to generation like pottery, cobbler, wood work

commercial production?
the replication or mass production of a technology


software are more expensive than hardwares?
in hardware, you just make one new product and then go for mass production. so it was just one time effort.
in software's case, you always design a new software. you need man power working hours.


method = sequence of steps to perform a task.(recipe) Examle steps to compute factorial (algo)
tool = help out the method to perform the task. Example c++
procedure = method + tool (the detailed process involving method and tool) = (the code in c++ for factorial)
paradigm = philosphy which drives your procedures (like OOP or (procedural or function oriented)) 

Bug:
is a generic terrm if the software is not working

error: human mistake (cusomer asked you to multiple two numbers, but undertood it wrong as addition of two numbers)
 
fault : due to human mistake, your software may have some fault, (now your software has implemented addition operation )

failure: the software does not behave as desired or required ( when the customer used or tested your software, he reported that is not working as desired, it is adding instead of multiplying)
