software engineering

what are you expecting from this course?

what is the difference between cycling and a boring syllabus book

if you live something, you cant forget..


do you think that you are a genius? raise your hand if you are!


assume you are in your first class like nursery , playgroup
every one will raise hand in playgroup,

teachers are responsible for taking down your confidence




grading system is actually degrades you.

you are A grade
B grade
D grade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!





you are neither superior nor you are inferior, you are just different, it is your effort what you achieve

just look at your thumb impression, in the same way your brain is different.

engineering?

computer science / software engineering


science vs engineering vs technology



science = set of rules and theories example (lever arm or moment arm, how the CPU the works)
technology = the tools built using the knowldge  of science (wrench, screw driver, java)
engineering  = the systematic process to build a new thing (technology) using the science.


we take knowlege from science, apply engineering and build technology.

An engineer provides solution to the problems using scientific theories, please note every problem is a new problem.


engineering = designing
coding = implementation = labour work
